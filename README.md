cs132_final
===========

The goal of this project is to create an app for Providence's WaterFire that allows participants to customize and/or enhance their experience at the event remotely through their mobile smartphone.  We will be implementing two crowdsourcing features, one that allows participants to suggest a change in volume by region and the other for feeding the fires.  The app will be extendable to allow more features to be added in the future.

##Getting Started

I took the liberty of selecting git as our versioning control and github to store our repository.  If you've taken CS32 already then you've used version control before but if you haven't then welcome to the world of sharing code. Check out https://github.com/ and follow the set up guide and create an account.

I have already created a repository and set up a skeleton for our project. As you may read in the "Fork A Repo" guide on github, you can get the files by using "clone" in the following manner.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/crdunwel/cs132_final.git
# Clones your fork of the repository into the current directory in terminal
```

Once you clone the project you should install the node modules we will (likely) be using as I defined in the package.json.

```
$ npm install
```

As a note, I have added the directory "node_modules/" to the ".gitignore" file so we don't run into conflicts from computer to computer.

##Quick Git Guide

I am no means an expert on Git and if you would like to learn more then please check out http://git-scm.com/.  I am just going to briefly explain what versioning is and provide a short summary of the key commands we will be using to share our code.

If you followed the link you will see that "Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency." All this means is that Git is a system that provides the functionality for keeping track of and sharing the state of code as it changes.

You already used the "clone" function above.
